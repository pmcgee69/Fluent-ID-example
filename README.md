# Fluent-ID-example
Example of debugging fluent style code in Delphi using the identity transformation.

Starting from example code mentioned on StackOverflow : https://stackoverflow.com/a/5104244/8106387
and having retrieved the old code                     : https://web.archive.org/web/20110227200636/http://paste.ideaslabs.com/show/lzILqOs6PK

I played with an idea that seemed logical from a Functional Programming perspective ... the Identity transformation ... that just returns exactly what you give it.

I didn't know what that would look like in Delphi ... until I tried it.

Code here, plus the original file, and a video of debug stepping through the code.
